# GD32F350-gumstick
A gumstick form factor development board for GD32F350 MCU

Designed in KiCAD, brings out PWM0.1P, 0.1N, 0.2P, 0.2N, 15.0P, 15.0N, 16.0P and 16.0N, along with 4 ADC pins and I2C1. Designed for prototyping low cost ARM-based SMPS applications, but is also good for other applications. Uses CP2102N for downloading, see my other repo for gcc firmware library port and downloading tool.
